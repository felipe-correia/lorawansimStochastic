# LoRaWAN_simulator

The simulator allows modelling a multi-GW LoRaWAN GW and has been collbaboratively developed by Riccardo Marini (University of Bologna, Italy), Konstantin Mikhaylov(University of Oulu, Finland), Gianni Pasolini(University of Bologna, Italy) and Chiara Buratti(University of Bologna, Italy). The simulator has been partially used and  its design and evaluation are further detailed in the paper:

We would appreciate a reference to this paper in your paper, should you find this simulator useful for your studies (&also for tracking reasons) :)
